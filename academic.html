  I started schooling at an early age of three. Maybe I was a genious-I don't
  know. So, it was Wagura Nursery School that I first set foot on my first day
  in my first learning institution. Yes, it was a nursery school, not a
  kindergaten, i'm not a kindergaten kid. That was back in the days.
</p>
<p>
  After two years, I graduated from nursery school. I joined standard one in the
  year 2007. Being the shortest pupil ( again not a student ), I was at the
  receiving end of every kind of bullying. Life was intorelable at first.
  However, as time crawled by, the free millet and sorghum-porridge switched my
  mind to adjust. So, working through thick and thin, I was through with primary
  education after 3-term eight good years. Luckily, I passed, just passed. Don't
  want to know how passed.
</p>
<p>
  2016 saw me in Mukibi Educational Institute for the Sons and Daughters of African Ladies and
  Gentlemen.Funny as it's name, life at Mukibi was more than high school life. Yes,
  I never held myself. Four years down the line, I gave life my everything, no
  more to tell. However, inspite of eating life with a big spoon, inspite of
  giving life all, I passed, just passed, period.
</p>
<p>I'm now in KU, pursuing my bacholor's degree in IT, serious than never.</p>
