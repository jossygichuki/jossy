      My history is such brief.It dates back in late '90s. Born and brought in
      the countryside, life has taught me alot. Here, skills like working with
      farm tools are considered inborn and not acquired. So, my case was no
      exeption.

      Interestingly, my life has been shaped by tarnished patches of a variety
      of tragedies,joined into one big tragedy I call life. To begin with, the 2007-2008 post-elections 
      clashes found me in standard two. A drought followed in the year 2009, the sun was
      so hot that it threatened to melt my small stature.

       As if that was not enough, the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, which almost brought the world to a
      standstill, sums them all. It found me in form three, last term. Schooling
      was halted for some months but resumed later with strict containment measures and precautions enforced.
      <p>
        Those are the tragedies i've witnessed in my short stay under the stars, but who knows what more does the future
        holds.
